# Windows Classic animated cursor scheme
A Windows Classic cursor set that I extracted from a Windows XP image, and animated the hourglass based on the animation it has on some of the alternate cursor schemes:

Look at him go!

I also expanded the scheme with some cursor shapes that were added in Windows 10 (Location Select, Person Select).

I'm uploading this here for easy access, as I'm using it on all of my systems and up until now, it was only available as a Discord attachment link in a Twitter reply thread.
